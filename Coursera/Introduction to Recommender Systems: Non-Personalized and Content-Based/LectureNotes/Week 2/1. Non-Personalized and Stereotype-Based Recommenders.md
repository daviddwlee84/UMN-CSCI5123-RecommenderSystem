# Non-Personalized and Stereotype-Based Recommenders

Why Non-Personalized

* New users - we know little about them (cold start)
* Simple but beneficial
* Online communities around common displays
  * e.g. reddit, slashdot
* Applications & media where personalization is impossible

It can be remarkably effective

## Intro: Recommendation in Print

Long tradition of recommendation in print

* Book, movie, and music reviews
* Restaurant guides
* ...

Each of these is *editorially selected*

### Examples

* Aggregate Opinion: Zagat Survey
* Aggregate Behavior: Billboard
* Other
  * E-commerce rating & review summaries
  * ...

## Weak Personalization

* Zip code or location
* Age, gender, nationality, ethnicity

This can be used for fist-pass 'stereotyped' personalization

Product associations allow recommendations based on current page/item/context
