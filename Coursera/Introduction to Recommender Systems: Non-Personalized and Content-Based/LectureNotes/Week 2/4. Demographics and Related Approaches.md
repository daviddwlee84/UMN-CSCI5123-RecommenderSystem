# Demographics and Related Approaches

> Lack of personalization (loosely personalize)

## Demographics

### What and Why?

Motivation

* Popularity may not represent my tastes
* I may be part of an identifiable cohort with different tastes
  * age
  * gender
  * race / ethnicity
  * socio-economic status
  * location
* Including non-demographics that may be predictive

### How

* Start by identifying available demographics (and correlates)
  * Many will require processing or bucketing
    * age is often divided into groups
    * postal codes can be transformed into socio-economic status, urban/rural, dominant ethnicity, etc.
* Then explore where your data correlates with demographics
  * scatterplots
  * correlations

### If you find relevant demographics

1. Break down summary statistics by demographic
   * e.g. most popular item for women, for men
   * maybe even factorial (most popular item for man 40-60)
2. Consider a multiple regression model
   * Predict items based on demographic statics
     * Linear regression for multi-valued (e.g. rating) data
     * Logistic regression for 0/1 (e.g. purchase) data

### Important

* You need defaults for unknown demographics (distribution of preference in my understanding)
  * may simply be overall preferences
  * may reflect expected demographics of new comers
  * may be modeled separately
* If demographics are useful, getting data on users is key
  * various sources of data, from advertising networks to loyalty club sign-ups and surveys
  * in some cases, demographics can be "predicted" from data

### Power and Limits

* In many cases, demographics work because products or content is created to reach them
  * television programs
  * magazine article and advertisements
  * personal products
* Or products simply naturally appeal to different groups
* Of course, demographics fail miserably for people whose tastes don't match their demographics

Which of the following situations do you think would work best with classic demographics (age, gender, geography)?  And why?  

Recommending political blogs (or columns) to read  
21.82%

Recommending news articles for person to read  
39.53%

Recommending the right courses for a learner studying on Coursera  
8.70%

Recommending medical treatments  
29.93%

Now that you’ve seen others’ responses, let’s share ours. We think it is unlikely that courses or medical treatments correlate enough with demographics to be good recommendations (though it is certainly true that certain topics have different gender or age distributions, as do medical treatments).  We’d probably go with political columns or blogs, at least in the US, as politics tends to have local divisions (for geography) and there are certainly divisions by gender, age, etc.).  News article recommendation might have some demographic elements, but we hope that what news is important now would be a more important factor.  

One more thought … if you’re thinking about educational recommenders, different types of demographics might be useful.  If you have information on learning styles, for instance (sometimes considered psychographics), it might help narrow down which course among alternatives is most likely to be successful in helping a student learn.
