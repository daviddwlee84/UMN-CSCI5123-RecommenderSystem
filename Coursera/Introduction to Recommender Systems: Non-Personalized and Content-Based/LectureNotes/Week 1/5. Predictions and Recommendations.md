# Predictions and Recommendations

> Output of a recommender system

## Predictions

* Estimates of how much you'll like an item
  * Often scaled to match some rating scale
    * Star scale
    * Likes
  * Often tied to search or browsing for specific product

> * Pro: helps quantity item
> * Con: provides something falsifiable

## Recommendations

* Recommendations are suggestions for items you might like (or might fit what you're doing)
  * Often presented in the form of "top-n"
    * just gave the item (don't show the prediction)
  * ...

> * Pro: provides good choices as a default
> * Con: if perceived as top-n, can result in failure to explore (if top few seem poor)

## Explicit vs. Organic

> How explicit is the prediction or recommendation

* Balance between explicit prediction (falsifiable) and coarser granularity (you might like this)
* Balance between these are the best (top-n) and softer presentation (here are some that might be interesting)
