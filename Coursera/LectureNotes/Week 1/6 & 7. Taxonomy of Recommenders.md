# Taxonomy of Recommenders

## Analytical Framework

### Dimensions of analysis

* Domain
* Purpose
* Recommendation Context
* Whose Opinions
* Personalization Level
* Privacy and Trustworthiness
* Interfaces
* Recommendation Algorithms

Content to Commerce and Beyond

* News, information, "text"
* Products, vendors, bundles
* Matchmaking (other people)
* Sequences (e.g. music playlists)

One particularly interesting property

* New items (e.g. movies, books, ...)
* Re-recommend old ones (e.g. groceries, music)

## Purpose of Recommendation

* The recommendations themselves
  * sales
  * information
* Education of user/customer
* Build a community of users/customers around products or content

## Recommendation Context

* What is the user doing at the time of recommendation?
  * Shopping
  * Listening to Music
  * Hanging out with other people
    * recommend for group instead of individual
* How does the context constrain the recommender
  * Groups, automatic consumption (vs. suggestion), level of attention, level of interruption

## Whose Opinion

* "Experts"
  * wine
* Ordinary "phoaks" (People Help One Another Know Stuff)
* People like you

## Personalization Level

* Generic / Non-Personalized
  * Everyone receives some recommendations
* Demographic
  * Matches a target group
* Ephemeral
  * Matches current activity
* Persistent
  * Matches long-term interests

## Privacy and Trustworthiness

Wno knows what about me?

* Personal information revealed
* Identity
* Deniability of preferences

Is the recommendation honest?

* Biases built-in by operator
  * "business rules"
* Vulnerability to external manipulation
* Transparency of "recommenders"; Reputation

## Interfaces

Types of output

* Predictions
* Recommendations
* Filtering
* Organic vs. explicit presentation
  * Agent/Discussion Interface

Types of input

* Explicit
* Implicit

## Recommendation Algorithms

* Non-Personalized Summary Statistics
* Content-Based Filtering
  * Information Filtering
  * Knowledge-Based
* Collaborative Filtering
  * User-User
  * Item-Item
  * Dimensionality Reduction
* Others
  * Critique/Interview Based Recommendations
  * Hybrid Techniques

### Basic Model

* Users
  * User Attributes (demographics)
* Items
  * Item Attributes (properties, genres, etc)
* Ratings - Express opinion
* (Community) - Space

### Non-Personalized Summary Stats

> Usually we don't need a model

* External Community Data
  * Best-seller, Most popular, Trending Hot
* Summary of Community Ratings
  * Best-liked

Matrix of user-item

Average ratings

> Examples:
>
> * Restaurant ratings
> * Music rankings
> * Hotel ratings

### Content-Based Filtering

* User Ratings x Item Attributes => Model
  * map the rating to the product
* Model applied to new items via attributes
* Alternative: knowledge-based
  * Item attributes from model of item space
    * Users navigate/browse that space

> Examples:
>
> * Personalized news feeds
> * Artist or Genre music feeds

### Personalized Collaborative Filtering

* Use opinions of others to predict/recommend
* User model - set of ratings
* Item model - set of ratings
* Common core: sparse matrix of ratings
  * Fill in missing values (predict)
  * Select promising cells (recommend)
* Several different technique

Matrix of user-item, usually sparse (if the matrix are full, we don't need a recommendation system, we know everybody's opinions about everything)

#### Collaborative Filtering Techniques

* User-user
  * Select neighborhood of similar-taste people
    * Variant: select people you know/trust (trust-based recommendation)
  * Use their opinions
* Item-item
  * Pre-compute similarity among items via ratings
  * Use own ratings to triangulate for recommendation
* Dimensionality reduction
  * Intuition taste yields a lower-dimensionality matrix
  * Compress and use a taste representation
  * User-taste & Taste-item matrix

#### Interactive recommenders

* Critique-based
* Dialog-based

## Note on Evaluation

To properly understand relative metrics of each approach, we will spend significant time on evaluation

* Accuracy of predictions
* Usefulness of recommendations
  * Correctness
  * Non-obviousness
  * Diversity
* Computational performance
