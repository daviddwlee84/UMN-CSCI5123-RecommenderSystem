    * Temporary (e.g. Pandora 30-day suspend)
* **Implicit** - data collected from user actions
  * Click
    * Search result
    * Click vs. didn't click
  * Purchase
  * Follow/Friend
  * Reading Time

Difficulties with Ratings

* Are ratings reliable and accurate?
* Do user preference change?
* What dows a rating mean?

Subtleties and Difficulties of Implicit data

* What dows the action mean?
  * Purchase: they might still hate it
  * Don't click: expect bad, or didn't see
* How to scale/represent actions?
* Lots of opportunity to be creepy

Conclusion

* Recommenders mine what users say and what they do to learn preferences
* Ratings provide explicit expressions of preference
* Implicit data benefits from greater volume
